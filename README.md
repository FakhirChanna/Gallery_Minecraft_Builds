<p>Cool! What's the world size? : 4k by 4k seems small except don't worry new areas would be added in edges for now it's big enough and it's small for gameplay reason.</p>
<p>where can i check the world? Download Here : </p>
<p>is it heavily modded : No fully vanilla no new bs or changes only quality of life + serverside with backpack mod.
<p>modlist? where : [here](list.html)
<p>why the name : RenaissanceCascade (Renaissance is very high medieval name quite don't you think and cascade is just like major event kinda the point is to make so that players are immersed in rich world filled with history to explore)</p>
<p>how many players are max in server : We are planning to add as many player as we can handle</p>
<p>what are rules : don't hack, crash server,build massive farms, dox other user and spread drama doing this will get instant ban cold-blooded style. 

<p>How many members are working on it? : currently only 2 people are working on it as project is quite new</p>
| Members       |      Rank 	|
| ------------- |      :---: 	|
| Fakhir  	  | Admin, Owner, Builder, Map Creator |
| yviteli_parketi | Assistant, Overseer, playtester |

<p>we are looking for more people to contribute but don't expect payment the this may change in future if project get funds.</p>
<p>But we will try hardest to pay any serious help but please understand this is hobby project first and foremost.</p>
